# Removal of process_request Backward Compatibility

This update removes backward compatibility with the deprecated `process_request` method, focusing exclusively on the `handle_request` approach.

## Changes Made

1. **API Simplification**
   - Removed the deprecated `process_request` method from the `AbstractService` trait
   - Updated all service implementations to remove their `process_request` methods
   - Updated client code to use `handle_request` instead of `process_request`

2. **Code Cleanup**
   - Removed unnecessary `#[allow(deprecated)]` attributes
   - Simplified service implementations by focusing on a single request handling method
   - Updated mixins to use consistent naming with `handle_request` instead of `process_request`

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Removed all references to backward compatibility with `process_request`
   - Updated examples to show only the modern `handle_request` approach
   - Added notes about the API simplification

## Migration Guide

For any code still using `process_request`, follow these steps:

1. **Find and Replace**: Search for all instances of `process_request` in your code and replace with `handle_request`
2. **Update Tests**: Make sure all tests are updated to use `handle_request` instead of `process_request`
3. **Check for Mixins**: If you have custom mixins, update their method names for consistency
4. **Review Documentation**: Make sure any documentation you maintain is updated to reflect the new API

## Benefits

1. **API Clarity**: Removes confusion about which method to use
2. **Code Simplicity**: Reduces the amount of code in services
3. **Performance**: Eliminates an unnecessary method call for backward compatibility
4. **Modernization**: Aligns with current best practices for Rust API design
