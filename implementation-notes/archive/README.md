# Implementation Notes Archive

This directory contains archived implementation details and historical code that may be valuable for reference but are no longer actively used in the current codebase.

## Contents

- `action_macro_implementation_details.md` - Technical details on fixes for the original action macro implementation
- `original-code/` - Original versions of code files for historical reference
  - `action_macro_original.rs` - The original implementation of the action macro before simplification

## Purpose

This archive serves several purposes:

1. **Historical Reference** - Understand the evolution of the codebase and implementation decisions
2. **Technical Learning** - Provides examples of proc-macro implementation challenges and solutions
3. **Future Development** - May contain insights useful for future macro implementations

## Relationship to Current Documentation

The current approach to macros is documented in:

- `/markdown/services/macro_usage_guide.md` - Current usage patterns and best practices
- `/markdown/services/macros.md` - Overview of the simplified macro system
- `/specs/completed/macro_testing_implementation_plan.md` - Testing approach for macros

## Note on Documentation Standards

In accordance with our documentation standards:

1. Active documentation should be kept in appropriate directories based on its purpose
2. Historical implementation details should be archived rather than deleted
3. Documentation should be consolidated to avoid duplication
4. References to archived content should be clear about its historical nature
