# Runar Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Runar distributed system framework.

## Overview

Runar is a powerful Rust-based framework for building resilient, peer-to-peer and distributed microservice applications with end-to-end encryption. It provides a declarative API making it easy to define services, handle actions, and manage communication between system components.

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Core Systems

Runar's architecture is built around several core systems that work together:

- **Service Registry**: Manages service registration, discovery, and communication
- **Request Context**: Provides uniform interface for service communication
- **ValueMap (VMap)**: Type-safe parameter handling with automatic conversion
- **Logging System**: Component-based structured logging
- **Lifecycle Management**: Service initialization, startup, and shutdown

### Security Architecture

- **PKI Infrastructure**: X.509 certificate-based identity and authentication
- **Envelope Encryption**: Multi-recipient encryption for cross-device data sharing
- **Selective Field Encryption**: Field-level encryption with label-based key resolution
- **Mobile Key Management**: Self-custodied keys with mobile wallet integration

### Communication Patterns

- **Request/Response**: Synchronous service-to-service communication
- **Publish/Subscribe**: Event-driven communication for loose coupling
- **P2P Transport**: QUIC-based secure peer-to-peer communication
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic service discovery across the network

## Quick Reference

### Service Definition with Macros

```rust
use runar_macros::{action, service, subscribe};

#[service(
    name = "math_service",
    path = "math",
    description = "Simple arithmetic API",
    version = "1.0.0"
)]
struct MathService;

impl MathService {
    #[action]
    async fn add(&self, a: f64, b: f64, ctx: &RequestContext) -> Result<f64> {
        ctx.debug(format!("Adding {a} + {b}"));
        Ok(a + b)
    }
}
```

### Node Setup

```rust
use runar_node::{Node, NodeConfig};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let config = NodeConfig::new_with_generated_id("default_network");
    let mut node = Node::new(config).await?;
    
    node.add_service(MathService).await?;
    
    let result: f64 = node.request("math/add", Some(params)).await?;
    println!("Result: {}", result);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Encryption Example

```rust
// Mobile side - encrypt data for sharing
let envelope = mobile.encrypt_with_envelope(
    data,
    &network_id,
    vec!["personal".to_string(), "work".to_string()],
)?;

// Node side - decrypt using network key
let decrypted = node.decrypt_envelope_data(&envelope)?;
```

## Contributing

We welcome early contributors who share our vision of **secure, self-hosted software**.

1. Read the [architecture & guidelines](core/architecture).
2. Discuss sizeable changes in a GitHub issue before opening a PR.
3. Follow the *Documentation-First* workflow (update docs & tests **before** code).
4. Ensure `cargo test` passes and `cargo fmt` shows no diff.

Not sure where to start? Check `development/` for good first issues and the current roadmap.
