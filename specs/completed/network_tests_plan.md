# Network Testing Plan

## Status: COMPLETED

This plan has been successfully implemented. The detailed documentation has been moved to:
- [Multicast Discovery Implementation](../completed/multicast_discovery_implementation.md)

## Overview

The plan focused on implementing and testing the network stack separately from the node, with emphasis on:

1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for combined functionality
3. Special focus on UDP multicast discovery

## Objectives (Completed)

- ✅ Create comprehensive unit tests for transport layer
- ✅ Create comprehensive unit tests for discovery components
- ✅ Implement integration tests for combined transport and discovery
- ✅ Fix UDP multicast discovery implementation
- ✅ Add proper tests for multicast discovery with fallbacks

## Key Accomplishments

1. Fixed multicast discovery implementation with proper socket handling
2. Added robust integration tests for all network components
3. Implemented fallback mechanisms for environments where multicast is not available
4. Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
5. Made tests more reliable with retries and timeouts

All network components are now thoroughly tested and working correctly.
