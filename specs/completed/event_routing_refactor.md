# Event Routing Refactoring Plan

## Current Status

We've made significant progress with event routing:

1. âœ… Fixed the core event routing issue with topic path handling
2. âœ… Implemented consistent path formatting throughout the system
3. âœ… Ensured proper event delivery from publishers to subscribers
4. âœ… Added detailed debug logging for better diagnostics

## Remaining Issues

1. **Compilation Errors**: Several test files are still failing compilation
   - Missing `topic_path` field in `ServiceRequest` initializations
   - References to outdated macro-based services
   - `event_service.rs` using outdated field names (`params` vs. `data`)

2. **Code Quality Issues**:
   - Some code is still referring to outdated patterns and methods
   - Legacy macro-based tests need to be cleaned up

## Refactoring Steps

### Phase 1: Fix Core Event Routing âœ… (Completed)

1. âœ… Fixed `NodeRequestHandlerImpl::publish` to pass full topic path to ServiceRegistry
2. âœ… Updated `NodeRequestHandlerImpl::subscribe_with_options` for consistent path handling
3. âœ… Fixed `NodeRequestHandlerImpl::unsubscribe` to match the subscription approach
4. âœ… Added detailed debug logging to trace event flow
5. âœ… Fixed the `unsubscribe_wrapper` method in `ServiceRegistry`

### Phase 2: Address Compilation Errors ðŸ”„ (In Progress)

1. Fix the ServiceRequest initialization in test files
   - Add missing `topic_path` field to all ServiceRequest instances
   - Ensure all fields are correctly initialized according to current API

2. Fix the event service fixture implementations
   - Update ValueType usage to match current API
   - Ensure consistent method signatures and parameter handling

3. Resolve missing field errors
   - Update macro-based services to be compatible with current API structure
   - Add transition path for legacy macro-based implementations

### Phase 3: Clean Up and Documentation ðŸ”„ (In Progress)

1. Document the refactoring approach in detail
2. Add deprecation notices to legacy code
3. Update tests to use the new architectural patterns
4. Add README documentation explaining the migration path

## Implementation Details

### ServiceRequest Changes

The ServiceRequest structure now requires a `topic_path` field, which must be properly initialized:

```rust
ServiceRequest {
    source: String,
    service: String,
    path: String,
    data: Option<ValueType>,
    id: Option<String>,
    topic_path: Option<TopicPath>, // Required field
}
```

### Event Publishing Changes

Following our architectural principles, event publishing follows these patterns:

1. Clean separation between publisher and subscriber services
2. Direct API calls using request-based communication
3. Proper topic path handling for routing

### Deprecation Path

We are maintaining macro-based services in a separate directory for backward compatibility, but all new tests should use the direct API implementation.

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Fixed core event routing with topic paths
