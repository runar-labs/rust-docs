# Runar Project Migration Status

## Overview

This document summarizes the status of the Runar project migration. The migration involved renaming components, updating references, removing duplicate code, and ensuring everything compiles and runs as expected.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Code Consolidation and Deduplication
- ✅ Analyzed duplicate code between rust-common, kagi_utils, utils, kagi_node, test_service_info
- ✅ Created a consolidation plan with mapping of which files go where
- ✅ Moved all common utilities and shared code to rust-common crate
- ✅ Updated all import paths across the codebase to point to consolidated code in rust-common
- ✅ Ensured proper dependency structure in Cargo.toml files after consolidation
- ✅ Verified no critical functionality was lost during consolidation
- ✅ Updated tests to reflect new import paths
- ✅ Verified the build works with consolidated code
- ✅ Removed redundant packages after verification (kagi_utils, utils, etc.)

### 2. Renaming from Kagi to Runar
- ✅ Created a comprehensive grep search to identify all "kagi" references throughout the codebase
- ✅ Updated all file and directory names from "kagi_*" to "runar_*"
- ✅ Updated package names in Cargo.toml files
- ✅ Updated module names and references in source code
- ✅ Updated documentation references from "kagi" to "runar"
- ✅ Updated README files and other project documentation
- ✅ Ensured all references to the project in comments are updated
- ✅ Verified proper references to implementations (rust-runar-node, go-runar-node, ts-runar-node)

### 3. Macro Analysis and Reorganization
- ✅ Identified all macros across the codebase
- ✅ Created inventory of macros in rust-node core package
- ✅ Determined which macros should move to rust-macros
- ✅ Migrated appropriate macros to rust-macros package
- ✅ Updated all references to moved macros
- ✅ Ensured backward compatibility or provided clear migration path
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation for all macros and their usage
- ✅ Written tests for moved macros

### 4. Rust-docs Reorganization
- ✅ Planned structure for GitHub Pages compatible documentation
- ✅ Created a clear separation between source docs and built docs
- ✅ Set up a build process for generating static website from markdown
- ✅ Organized specs, public docs, and website builder
- ✅ Created a directory structure for specification organization
- ✅ Consolidated documentation and removed duplication
- ✅ Ensured correct implementation-specific references

### 5. Integration and Testing
- ✅ Verified that all crates build successfully after changes
- ✅ Ran the full test suite across all submodules
- ✅ Created basic example services for testing
- ✅ Implemented tools for testing macro expansion
- ✅ Documented the testing approach for macros

## Current Structure

The core components of our system are:
- **rust-node**: The system core
- **rust-macros**: Contains the macro functionality that enables simple service definition
- **rust-common**: Central location for all common utilities

The documentation is organized into:
- **specs**: Technical specifications and implementation plans
- **markdown**: Source Markdown files for public documentation
- **website**: Generated documentation website
- **build**: Website builder code (MD to HTML conversion)

## Next Steps

1. Complete the GitHub Actions workflow for automatic docs deployment
2. Implement comprehensive examples for macros and services
3. Expand testing coverage for edge cases
4. Create a more detailed versioning strategy
5. Update CI/CD pipelines to reflect the new structure

## Lessons Learned

1. **Modular Design**: Separating macros from core functionality improves maintainability
2. **Documentation Structure**: Clear separation of specifications from public documentation improves organization
3. **Testing Approach**: Testing procedural macros requires specialized approaches
4. **Migration Strategy**: Systematic approach to renaming and reorganization prevents regression
