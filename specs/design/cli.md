new crate runar-cli

The first feature of the CLI is the initialization of the node

runar -init or just runar (and the cli detects there is not config so goes into init mode)


If the user does runar -init and previos cnfig exists.. need to confirm with the user..

config is in the same folder as the runar binary in the .runar folder
