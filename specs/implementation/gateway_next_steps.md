# Gateway Implementation: Next Steps

## Overview

The gateway macros have been successfully implemented, but there are several key areas that need attention before the gateway implementation is complete and ready for production use. This document outlines the remaining tasks and their priorities.

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Align Gateway Implementation with Macros

- **Issue**: The current gateway implementation in `lib.rs` uses a different approach than what the macros expect
- **Tasks**:
  - Update the route registration mechanism to work properly with the new macros
  - Ensure the `handle_http_request` function can properly dispatch to services
  - Fix type compatibility issues between macro-generated code and runtime expectations
  - Update service context propagation in the request handling chain

### 2. Test Gateway Implementation

- **Issue**: The gateway example has compilation errors and doesn't work with the new macro implementations
- **Tasks**:
  - Update the example code to work with new macro implementations
  - Create unit tests for each macro and its generated code
  - Create integration tests that verify end-to-end functionality
  - Test with multiple services to ensure proper routing and dispatching

### 3. Fix Static Route Registry

- **Issue**: The current approach using static mutable variables (`ROUTES`) has safety issues
- **Tasks**:
  - Consider using a proper dependency injection approach
  - Leverage `linkme` more effectively for safer distributed slices
  - Implement thread-safe access patterns for the registry
  - Add comprehensive error handling for route registration failures

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 4. Complete WebSocket Support

- **Issue**: WebSocket handling is partially implemented but not fully connected to the service system
- **Tasks**:
  - Complete the WebSocket upgrade handling
  - Implement proper message parsing and forwarding system
  - Connect WebSocket messages to the appropriate services
  - Add support for connection lifecycle management (heartbeats, graceful disconnects)

### 5. Enhance Error Handling

- **Issue**: Error handling could be improved in several areas
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement better error messages for route matching failures
  - Add proper handling of service errors
  - Create structured error responses with consistent formats
  - Add detailed logging for error conditions

### 6. Improve CORS and Middleware Support

- **Issue**: The middleware chain is implemented, but integration with services needs work
- **Tasks**:
  - Ensure middleware specified in macros is correctly applied
  - Make sure authentication and authorization flow properly
  - Implement a more flexible CORS configuration system
  - Add support for per-route middleware specifications

## Lower Priority Tasks

### 7. Configuration Management

- **Issue**: Configuration is currently hardcoded in many places
- **Tasks**:
  - Add proper configuration loading from files or environment
  - Implement dynamic configuration reloading
  - Add validation for configuration parameters
  - Create sensible defaults for common use cases

### 8. Logging and Metrics

- **Issue**: Logging is basic and metrics are missing
- **Tasks**:
  - Enhance logging for better debugging
  - Add metrics for monitoring (requests/second, latency, error rates)
  - Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Add support for tracing across service boundaries

### 9. Performance Optimization

- **Issue**: Performance has not been a focus yet
- **Tasks**:
  - Benchmark the gateway under various loads
  - Optimize route matching algorithm
  - Implement connection pooling for service-to-service communication
  - Add caching where appropriate

## Conclusion

By addressing these items in order of priority, we can complete the gateway implementation and ensure it's production-ready. The most immediate focus should be on aligning the macros with the gateway implementation and ensuring the test infrastructure is in place to validate functionality.
