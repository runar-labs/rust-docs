2. Architecture
   OpenSign follows a client-server architecture, leveraging modern web technologies to ensure scalability, security, and usability.
   High-Level Overview
   Frontend: A responsive single-page application (SPA) built with React.js and Material-UI.

Backend: A RESTful API server built with Node.js and Express.js, powered by your framework.

Database: PostgreSQL for structured data storage.

Document Storage: AWS S3 or a similar cloud storage service for scalability.

Third-Party Services: Integration with SendGrid for email notifications and PDF-lib for document manipulation.

Components
Frontend
User interface for document management, signature placement, and workflow configuration.

Dashboard to track document status.

Mobile-responsive design.

Backend
API endpoints for all functionalities.

Business logic for document processing, signature handling, and workflow management.

Integration with external services (e.g., email, cloud storage).

Database Schema (Simplified)
Users: id, email, password_hash, role, created_at, verified

Documents: id, user_id, title, file_path, status, created_at

Signers: id, document_id, email, name, order, status

Signatures: id, signer_id, field_id, signature_data, signed_at

AuditLogs: id, document_id, user_id, action, timestamp, details

Templates: id, user_id, name, document_id, created_at

3. Functional Requirements
   User Authentication

Storage: Store templates for user access.

Usage: Apply templates to new documents with placeholders for dynamic data.

API Layer
Endpoints: Provide RESTful APIs for all major functionalities (e.g., /documents, /signatures).

Security: Use API keys or OAuth for authentication.

Documentation: Include detailed API docs for developers.

Admin Panel
User Management: Add, edit, or delete users; assign roles.

System Settings: Configure defaults (e.g., email templates, document TTL).

Monitoring: View system stats and health metrics.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
   Security
   Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, documents) at rest and in transit.

HTTPS: Enforce secure communication.

Access Control: Implement role-based permissions and CSRF protection.

Audits: Conduct regular security reviews.

Performance
Concurrency: Support up to 1,000 concurrent users.

Response Time: Aim for under 2 seconds for most operations.

Efficiency: Optimize document processing and database queries.

Scalability

Compliance
Legal Standards: Adhere to ESIGN Act (US) and eIDAS (EU) for electronic signatures.

Binding Signatures: Ensure signatures are tamper-evident and legally enforceable.

Audit Trails: Meet regulatory requirements for record-keeping.

5. Technical Stack
   Frontend: React.js, Material-UI (for a polished UI).

Backend: Node.js, Express.js (integrated with your framework).

Database: PostgreSQL (for robust relational data management).

Document Storage: AWS S3 (or equivalent cloud storage).

PDF Manipulation: PDF-lib (for adding signature fields to PDFs).

Email Service: SendGrid (for reliable notifications).

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure sessions.

Deployment: Docker (for containerization), GitHub Actions (for CI/CD).

6. Deployment
