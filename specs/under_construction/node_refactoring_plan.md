# Node Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document consolidates the improvements for the Runar Node system, specifically focused on the Service Registry and Event System. It addresses architectural issues, responsibility allocation, and implementation details to create a more maintainable and correctly structured system.

## Current Issues

1. **Inappropriate responsibility allocation**: (RESOLVED)
   - Service Registry handles request routing, event publishing, and other concerns beyond registration
   - `handle_request` should not be in Registry - this is Node's responsibility
   - `publish` should not be in Registry - this is Node's responsibility or a dedicated EventBus

2. **Architectural flaws**: (MOSTLY RESOLVED)
   - Inconsistent path/name usage: Services are sometimes identified by name and sometimes by path (RESOLVED)
   - Topic normalization issues: Topics are normalized differently in different places (RESOLVED)
   - Context storage anti-pattern: Services incorrectly store RequestContext in their state (RESOLVED)
   - Thread-local storage anti-pattern: Thread-local storage used for current context (RESOLVED)
   - Monolithic handler methods: Services using generic `handle_request` or `handle_action` methods instead of registering specific handlers (RESOLVED)

3. **API issues**: (MOSTLY RESOLVED)
   - Subscription handling has excessive boilerplate (RESOLVED)
   - Inconsistent method parameters across the API (RESOLVED)
   - Missing request IDs in some requests (RESOLVED)
   - Deprecated methods still in use (RESOLVED)
   - Accessing action/event name via request.action_or_event instead of using TopicPath (RESOLVED)

## Architectural Boundaries

### ServiceRegistry Responsibilities

ServiceRegistry should ONLY be responsible for:
1. Service registration and lookup
2. Managing service metadata
3. Managing topic subscriptions (storing callbacks)
4. Providing subscribers for a given topic (without executing them)
5. Routing requests to the appropriate action handlers

### Service Implementation Pattern

1. Services should NO LONGER implement generic `handle_request` or `handle_action` methods
2. Instead, during initialization, services should register specific action handlers with the context
3. Each action should have its own dedicated handler function
4. Action handlers are registered in the init phase using `context.register_action("action_name", handler_function)`
5. The Node is responsible for finding the right service and action handler for a request

### Request Path & Topic Handling

1. Requests should have a complete TopicPath that identifies both service and action
2. Action/event names should be extracted from the TopicPath, not from separate fields
3. All path handling should use consistent TopicPath operations
4. Path normalization should follow a single, consistent pattern

### Methods That Have Been Removed from ServiceRegistry

1. `handle_request` - This method violated the architecture's separation of concerns (REMOVED)
   - All request handling is now done by the Node
   - Tests have been updated to use Node.handle_request

2. `publish` - This method violated the architecture's separation of concerns (REMOVED)
   - Event publishing is now the Node's responsibility
   - The registry only provides a way to retrieve subscribers for a topic

### Event System Improvements

1. Event callbacks should receive an EventContext parameter
   - Callbacks need to be able to publish other events or call actions
   - This requires a proper context to be passed to the callback

2. Subscription testing should verify:
   - That subscribers are correctly registered for a topic
   - That unsubscribe correctly removes subscribers
   - That the registry returns the correct subscribers when requested

## Important Implementation Guidelines

1. **API Stability**:
   - Maintain API compatibility for existing consumers
   - Follow documented API contracts
   - Changes must respect the existing architectural boundaries

2. **Follow Documented Intentions**:
   - Code must respect documented intentions in comments
   - Test intentions must be preserved during refactoring
   - Architectural principles must be followed

3. **API Consistency**:
   - Use consistent parameter naming across similar methods
   - Follow established patterns for context objects
   - Ensure consistent error handling

4. **Avoid Duplication**:
   - Don't duplicate functionality across components
   - Consolidate similar code into reusable utilities
   - Use trait implementations to share behavior

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Service Registry should ONLY handle registration and lookup
   - Node should manage request routing, event publishing and subscription
   - Each component should have a clear, focused responsibility

2. **Path-based Identity**
   - Services should be consistently identified by their paths, not names
   - Use TopicPath consistently throughout the system

3. **Context is Request-scoped, not Service-scoped**
   - RequestContext should NEVER be stored in service state
   - Context should only be passed as a parameter to methods that need it
   - Each request should have its own isolated context
   - LifecycleContext should be used for initialization and lifecycle operations

4. **Clean API Design**
   - API should be intuitive and consistent
   - Event type consistency (use ValueType::Map for service communication)
   - Simplified subscription handling with minimal boilerplate

5. **Constructor Design Pattern**
   - Avoid constructor proliferation with specialized methods for each parameter combination
   - Use a single primary constructor with required parameters only
   - Implement builder methods with `with_` prefix for optional parameters
   - Apply the builder pattern for fluent configuration
   - Group frequently co-occurring parameters into configuration objects

6. **Action Registration Over Handler Methods**
   - Services should register specific action handlers during initialization
   - Avoid monolithic handler methods that need to inspect action names
   - Each action should have its own dedicated handler function
   - The Node is responsible for finding and invoking the correct handler

## Node Lifecycle Management

An important aspect missing from the current implementation is proper Node lifecycle management. The Node should have a clear startup and shutdown flow that handles:

1. **Node Initialization and Startup**:
   - The Node should have a `start()` method that initializes all internal systems
   - During startup, it should start all registered local services in the proper order
   - When network functionality is added, it should advertise services to the network
   - Startup should be idempotent - calling start() multiple times should be safe, but the actual startup process should only execute when the node is not already started, or after a proper shutdown has been completed

2. **Service Lifecycle Orchestration**:
   - The Node should be responsible for calling `start()` on all services during its own startup
   - Services should be started in dependency order when possible
   - The Node should capture and handle any errors during service startup
   - The Node should manage and update the lifecycle state of each service in the centralized service metadata
   - The existing CompleteServiceMetadata system should be extended to include lifecycle state tracking and ensure it maintains all necessary service information (actions, subscriptions, state)

3. **Clean Shutdown**:
   - The Node should have a `stop()` method for graceful shutdown
   - During shutdown, it should stop all registered services in the proper order
   - It should clean up any resources, subscriptions, or pending events
   - Shutdown should be idempotent - calling stop() multiple times should be safe

4. **Lifecycle State Management**:
   - The Node should track the lifecycle state of each service
   - It should prevent operations on services that aren't in the correct state
   - It should provide a way to query the current state of services

All the unit tests for basic functionality are now passing, which marks significant progress in the refactoring plan. The implementation of Node.start() and Node.stop() lifecycle methods represents a key milestone in the Node's capability to properly manage service lifecycles. The remaining work focuses on enhancing the event system, implementing metrics collection, and completing the node lifecycle state tracking.

## ServiceRegistry API Changes

### 1. Action Registration API Change

The `register_action` method signature has been updated from:

```rust
pub async fn register_action(
    &self,
    topic_path: &TopicPath,
    action_name: &str,
    handler: ActionHandler,
) -> Result<()>
```

To the streamlined version:

```rust
pub async fn register_action(
    &self,
    action_path: &TopicPath,
    handler: ActionHandler,
) -> Result<()>
```

This change simplifies the API by:
- Removing the need to separate service path and action name
- Using a single TopicPath that already contains the action in its path
- Improving consistency with the get_action_handler method which also takes a single TopicPath
