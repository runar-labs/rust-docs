# ServiceInfo Refactoring

## Background

The Runar codebase had multiple definitions of the `ServiceInfo` trait, leading to confusion and compile errors. This refactoring aimed to centralize the trait definition in a common location and standardize its usage across the codebase.

## Changes Made

1. Created a new `common` crate to house the `ServiceInfo` trait.
2. Defined the `ServiceInfo` trait in `common/src/lib.rs` with the following methods:
   - `service_name(&self) -> &str`
   - `service_path(&self) -> &str`
   - `service_description(&self) -> &str`
   - `service_version(&self) -> &str`
3. Updated the `node` crate to use the `ServiceInfo` trait from the `common` crate.
4. Updated the `runar_macros` crate to import the `ServiceInfo` trait from the `common` crate.
5. Created a `test_service_info` crate to verify the trait implementation.
6. Renamed the `ServiceInfo` struct in `p2p/transport.rs` to `P2PServiceInfo` throughout the codebase to avoid confusion with the trait.

## Distinction Between ServiceInfo Trait and P2PServiceInfo Struct

It's important to understand the difference between two concepts in the codebase:

1. **ServiceInfo Trait** (from `runar_common`): A trait that defines methods for retrieving service metadata (name, path, description, version).
2. **P2PServiceInfo Struct** (in `p2p/transport.rs`): A data structure used for P2P service discovery that contains fields for name, path, and operations.

These concepts serve different purposes:
- The trait is used for general service metadata across the codebase.
- The struct is specifically used for P2P communication and service discovery.

## Areas That May Need Further Updates

1. **AbstractService Implementation**: The `AbstractService` trait could potentially implement the `ServiceInfo` trait, allowing any `AbstractService` to be used as a `ServiceInfo`. This would provide a more unified API.

2. **Macro Implementations**: The service macros have been updated to import and use the `ServiceInfo` trait from the common crate, but they may need further refinement to handle both the trait and the P2P struct.

3. **Tests**: Update tests that use either the trait or the struct to ensure they're properly using the intended type.

## Future Considerations

1. **Expansion of Common Traits**: Consider moving other common traits and interfaces to the `common` crate for better organization.

2. **Documentation**: Enhance documentation around services, their metadata, and discovery mechanisms to make the design clearer.

3. **API Consistency**: Review the service-related APIs for consistency and usability across the codebase.
