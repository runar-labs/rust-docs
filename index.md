# Kagi Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Kagi distributed system framework.

## Overview

Kagi is a powerful Rust-based framework for building resilient, peer-to-peer distributed applications. It provides a declarative API inspired by actor-based frameworks like Actix, making it easy to define services, handle actions, and manage communication between system components.
